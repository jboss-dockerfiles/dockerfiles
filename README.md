## Reasoning

There are a few reasons behind the move:

1. This will let us properly tag images, so you could stick to some version of the image.
2. Issues will be reported agains particular image, this will make it clear which image is affected.

## Issues

All issues and feture requests **must be** now filled in the appropriate repository. Issue feature for this repository was **disabled**.
